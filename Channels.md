### How do we raise customer awareness?
 We would not want to bite off more than we can chew at the beginning and would go for local businesses first to establish a strong foundation. Then we will expand to the larger businesses that are in town (i.e. Amertirade, Mutual of Omaha) before we went nationwide. In order to reach these local businesses we will deploy various forms of advertisement. Ads will be ran on sites such as Google and Facebook. We will also exploit sponsorship and community events. We will also have a website that will feature all of our products and service levels.
### How can customers evaluate our offerings?
 We understand that it may be difficult to assign a value on something that is new, so we would offer a three-month money back guarantee. We understand that it will take a bit of time to implement our security in with their system and, they will need time to adjust to any changes that were made. With that guarantee in place, they have a bit of breathing room and can decide for themselves if there is value in our product. Potential buyers will also be able to examine everything we have to offer on our website. Consumers will be able to view all levels of service side by side and decide which service level would serve them best. 
### How do customers purchase from us?
 We would list the details of our product on our website but when it comes to discussing the finer details of the deal, that is something we believe should be done in person. Our service levels provide a baseline for different levels of service, but we can adjust to meet customer needs. This will show that we take our product and customers seriously and highly value them.   
### How do we deliver value?
 We wish this were something simple but being able to show our value and value in our product is something that has to happen over time. We know that there are new security threats being developed everyday so we will strive to stay ahead of them by rolling out updates often. We will also check in regularly with our customer to see how things are going and if any changes must be made. We also offer a guarantee, if our product fails and a customer incures a financial loss, SkyNet will refund all losses up too $250,000. This will provide a sense of security to consumers who choose our product.
### How do we provide support?
 We understand that problems can be both big and small so our customer support must be flexible in that regard. The first point of contact will be through a call or email and have them explain the problem to us so we can determine the size of the problem. If itâ€™s a small problem, it can be handled remotely. For the larger problems, we will handle them remotely as well, if possible, but will also provide a team to go manage the problem on site, if needed. Customer support availability and response time will vary slightly based on level of service.
