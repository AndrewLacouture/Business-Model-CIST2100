# Key Resources

##### People and Departments

- As a new business it would serve us well to have a team of lawyers readily available. Especially since our business interacts with people's private data. We could also need some help with copyrights and securing any patents for new products we develope. There will also, most likely, be unexpected legal issues pop up here and there and it will be good to know that we have a trusted and adequate team by our side.  
- We will also need a talented financial department. Of all company records that will be kept, the finances are of utmmost importance. Any discrepancies in financial records could lead to substantial implications with the IRS. We will go through a very selevtive interview process to aquire these people and hire only candidates with an MBA for our management positions. 

#### Hardware: 

- Hardware will arguably be our most important resource, other than the people who use it. As a security business everything we do depends on the performace of our hardware. We will only source the best products from the most reputable suppliers. We also offer remote work, so we will need to ensure that all of our employees have access to top notch internet. SkyNet will incure some of the cost for the service.
