# Key Activities

 **Product Description**
 
All of our products will be digital since our service is something that will be integrated with digital platforms. Our cloud-based back-up offerings are going to be digital as well but will need physical resources (i.e. servers). We will be providing physical customer support as well. The creation of our products involves the usage of high-end computers and software for our programmers to create the encryption packages for our customers, but other than this technology, our production process is entirely digital as well.
 
 **Customer Problems and Solutions**
 
Online threats are something that businesses face everyday, and by providing the cybersecurity services that we do, our customers will be able to rest easy and focus more on the platform/product that they offer. We spend or time and resources on research and development to build and maintain the best defense so that our customers will not have to worry about a compromise or possible breach in their systems. Another problem that our customers might face might a loss of data or possible corruption, so we will provide a back-up service that will allow for them to recover their data.
 
 **Continued Support and Updates**
 
Obviously with new threats arising everyday, we must roll out updates often to keep our customers protected. For small updates we can roll them out online and communicate with out custmers over the phone/chat to explain what exactly we are updating. For larger updates/overhauls, we will be sending a small team to the customer's location so that integration with their platforms will go smoothly and any questions that they might have will be answered right away. Having a team there will allow for instant troubleshooting as well. In both cases, we will also take the opportunity to ask for feedback and suggestions, recording any frustrations they may have to help better tailor our products to their satisfaction in the future. Due to the personalized nature of our products, which will vary depending on the customer's needs and desires, we currently have no plans on developing a unified platform for our products, outside of a website to help our customers get started with us.
