# Key Activities

 **Will you be developing physical or digital products?**
 
All of our products will be digital since it is something that will be integrated with their platforms. Our cloud based back-up offferings are going to be digital as well but will need physical resources (i.e. servers). We will be providing physical cumsotmer support as well.
 
 **Will you be solving customer problems?**
 
Online threats are something that businesses face everyday and by providing the cybersecurity services that we do, the customer will be able to rest easy and focus more on their platform/product that they offer. We spend or time and resources on research and development to build and maintain the best defense so that our customers will not have to worry about a compromise or pssoible breach of their system. Another problem that our customers might face might a loss of data or possible corruption so we will provide a back-up service that will allow for them to recover their data.
 
 **Will you develop and maintain a platform for customers to use?**
 
Obviously with new threats arising everyday, we must roll out updates often to keep our customers protected. For small updates we can roll them out online and communicate with out custmers over the phone/chat to explain what exactly we are updating. For larger updates/overhauls, we will be sending a small team to the customer's location so that integration with their platforms will go smoothly and any questions that they might have will be answered right away. Having a team there will allows for instant troubleshooting as well.
