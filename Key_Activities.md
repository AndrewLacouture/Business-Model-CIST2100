# Key Activities

 **Product Description**
 
All of our products will be digital since our service is something that will be integrated with digital platforms. Our cloud-based back-up offerings are going to be digital as well but will need physical resources (i.e. servers). We will be providing physical customer support as well. In order to deliver our product to the customer we will have teams of sales associates available to take calls and engage in chats online. We would also go on site if the customer preferred. Once a sale is made we will begin to download and install the security software on their devices.

 **Customer Support and Solutions**
 
Security breaches are possible at all times of the day. This is why we will have teams of customer support and solutions experts. In order to serve our customers in the best way possible these team members will undergo extensive training for debugging all of our software. We will also offer the online chat option for customer support. We will have ample support agents to keep wait times to a minimum. For our premium customers we will also offer 24/7 support. This means we will have agents working on second and third shifts, just in smaller teams since call volume will be smaller. 
 
 **Continued Support and Updates**
 
Obviously with new threats arising everyday, we must roll out updates often to keep our customers protected. For small updates we can roll them out online and communicate with our custmers over the phone/chat to explain what exactly we are updating. To produce these updates we will have teams of developers working vigerously on the software. These teams will conduct research and stay informed on the latest strategies of hackers. For larger updates/overhauls, we will be sending a small team to the customer's location so that integration with their platforms will go smoothly and any questions that they might have will be answered right away. Having a team there will allow for instant troubleshooting as well. In both cases, we will also take the opportunity to ask for feedback and suggestions, recording any frustrations they may have to help better tailor our products to their satisfaction in the future. Due to the personalized nature of our products, which will vary depending on the customer's needs and desires, we will not be developing a unified platform for our products, howeveer we will develope a website to help our customers get started with us.
